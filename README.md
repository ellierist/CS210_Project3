# CS210_Project3

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   This project was for Corner Grocer, a grocery store. They needed a program that analyzes their daily text records. These text records include
   items purchased by customers throughout the day. This program provides a specific items frequency, all items and their frequency and a histogram
   version of the full frequency list. 

2) What did you do particularly well?
   I feel that I did my map loop and options well. 

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   I could have enhanced my code by having the menu separate to the main file and call the function. This code would have made it simpler for later
   revisions, which would have improved its stability.

4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or
   resources are you adding to your support network?
   

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
