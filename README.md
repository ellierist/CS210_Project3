# CS210_Project3

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   This project was for Corner Grocer, a grocery store. They needed a program that analyzes their daily text records. These text records include
   items purchased by customers throughout the day. This program provides a specific items frequency, all items and their frequency and a histogram
   version of the full frequency list. 

2) What did you do particularly well?
   I feel that I did my map loop and options well. 

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   I could have enhanced my code by having the menu separate to the main file and call the function. This code would have made it simpler for later
   revisions, which would have improved its stability.

4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or
   resources are you adding to your support network?
   The most challanging portion of this program was writing a map for the program. Since it was one of the first times I had used maps in C++, it 
   took me a while. I overcame this by reading the zybooks notes on how to create a map. This provided me enough information for me to write the map 
   and integrate it into analyzing information. 

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   I believe that most of the skills that it took to complete this project will help me going forward. Being able to pull information from files
   and write to files can be very useful to many projects. 

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   The program is readable as it is simple and there are comments to help make the program readble. 
   The menu options can easily be adapted and changed based on the needs of the user.
